      hyperboot is a webapp bootloader that puts users in control

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>offline</b> - once you've loaded an app, you have it cached locally
        forever. If you're on poor internet or no internet at all, the app will
        continue to function, at least in part.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>security</b> - versions are immutable and cached permanently in the user's
        browser. Once the initial payload has been verified, update hashes can be
        audited out of band through trusted channels. This mitigates a huge
        problem with browser cryptography: the website hosting the html can change
        at any time without warning.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>empowerment</b> - users are protected against a service that disappears
        without warning or starts adding user-hostile features. Apps can be
        trivially copied to the local disk or to another server.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>censorship-resistant</b> - once you've loaded an app, you have that app
        permanently stored in your browser. If the server hosting that application
        is forced to shut down, you still have the content. The more that apps use
        peer to peer technology such as WebRTC, the harder it will be to shut down
        the free flow of information.
